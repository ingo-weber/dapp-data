The event logs contain historic information about events that occurred during the execution of the DApps. Currently, the collection contains logs for the following Ethereum-based DApps: Augur: a prediction and betting marketplace; Forsage: an investment application, which turns out to be a PONZI scheme; CryptoKitties: a game where virtual cats can be bred and traded as assets; and ChickenHunt: a game for hunting chickens. All event logs from this collection follow the IEEE XES standard and were extracted using the Ethereum Logging Framework (ELF). In addition to the event log data, this website provides a description of the data in the event logs, pointers to DApp documentations, links to ELF scripts used for data extraction, and insights obtained from a preliminary analyses for each DApp event log. We invite users to contribute their own data sets to this collection. Data sets can be contributed via pull requests to our github repository. This collection is part of our work on process mining for blockchain-based applications. Details can be found in the following publications: C. Klinkmüller, A. Ponomarev, A.B. Tran, I.
