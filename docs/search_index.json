[["index.html", "A Collection of DApp Event Logs Overview", " A Collection of DApp Event Logs Overview This is a repository of event logs of decentralized applications (DApps) deployed on public blockchain networks. The event logs contain historic information about events that occurred during the execution of the DApps. Currently, the collection contains logs for the following Ethereum-based DApps: Augur: a prediction and betting marketplace; Forsage: an investment application, which turns out to be a PONZI scheme; CryptoKitties: a game where virtual cats can be bred and traded as assets; and ChickenHunt: a game for hunting chickens. All event logs from this collection follow the IEEE XES standard and were extracted using the Ethereum Logging Framework (ELF). In addition to the event log data, this website provides a description of the data in the event logs, pointers to DApp documentations, links to ELF scripts used for data extraction, and insights obtained from a preliminary analyses for each DApp event log. This collection is part of our work on process mining for blockchain-based applications. Details can be found in the following publications: C. Klinkmüller, A. Ponomarev, A.B. Tran, I.

Augurs white paper characterizes the mechanics of a prediction and betting market: individuals can speculate on the outcomes of future events; those who forecast the outcome correctly win money, and those who forecast incorrectly lose money. As a betting market organized on Ethereum, the developers claim that Augur bypasses disadvantages of traditional betting markets, such as trusted market operator and limited participation. 1.1 Data Overview Each trace in the Augur log captures the events that occur in relation to a specific betting market. Each trace has the following attributes: marketType (xs:string) - description (xs:string) - minPrice (xs:int) - maxPrice (xs:int) - blockNumber (xs:int) - time:timestamp (xs:date) - extraInfo (xs:string) - In addition, each event has a set of standard attributes: concept:name (xs:string) - The class of the event time:timestamp (xs:date) - The timestamp of the block that included the event lifecycle:transition (xs:string) - the lifecycle transition of each event, for all events set to Completed by default. This attribute exists to ensure compatibility with XES-certified tools blockNumber (xs:int) - The number of the block that included the event txIndex (xs:int) - The index of the transaction that included the event logIndex (xs:int) - The index of the log that included the event gasUsed (xs:int) - The amount of gas that was consumed by the transaction gasPaid (xs:int) - The amount of Ether that was paid for the execution of the transaction The following events can occur during a markets lifetime: create market - purchase complete sets - submit initial report - create dispute - contribute to dispute - redeem dispute crowdsourcer - complete dispute - finalize market - claim trading proceeds - redeem as initial reporter - transfer market - 1.2 Preliminary Analysis We conducted a case study on process mining for data extracted from Augur in [1]. To this end, we used process mining methods and tools to explore the data, discover models for a set of variants, and conduct conformance checking and performance analyses. In this regard, we found that the implementation diverged from the documented architecture of the DApp and identified interesting deviations from the normative process. An interview the chief architect of Augur validated our insights and more generally confirmed the usefulness of such insights for DApp development. References [1] R. Hobeck, C. Klinkmüller, H.M.N.D.

However, detailed analysis of the DApps mechanics, e.g., in [1], have shown that the DApp is in fact a Ponzi scheme, i.e., a fraud in which a few early investors generate profits based on the investments of later inverstors (see Wikipedia). On etherscan.io the DApp is currently marked as high risk with a note that this DApp is a Ponzi scheme. 2.1 Data Overview Each trace in the forsage log captures the events from the lifecycle of a Forsage user.

In their analysis, Kell et al. examine the generated event logs in detail, amongst others using a state machine to visualise the behavior of the contract, resulting in an estimation that around 88% of the Forsage users loose their investment, while only a small number of top-level participants is realizing gains. Complementary to the analysis by Kell et al., we here provide the historic information about the behavior of Forsage users. References [1] T. Kell, H. Yousaf, S. Allen, S. Meiklejohn and A.

While not Ethereums most serious application, it is a well-known example of a DApp (that is primarily based on smart contracts), has been used heavily at times (likely due some of the kitties being sold for thousands of dollars), and has been in operation since December 2017. A CryptoKitty is the Ethereum version of a Tamagotchi. It is a digital asset owned by an Ethereum account, it can be traded, and it can breed new CryptoKitties. To breed a new CryptoKitty, the owner of a CryptoKitty can start a siring process. That is, the owners CryptoKitty acts as the matron that gives birth to the new CryptoKitty which will then be owned by the matrons owner. However, the owner must have access to a second cat, the sire, either by owning it or by obtaining the permission of the sires owner in a siring auction. A CryptoKitty is represented by an identifier and its DNA, from which its features and appearance are derived. 3.1 Data Overview Each trace in the CryptoKitties log captures the events from the life of a single CryptoKitty. Each trace has the following attributes: concept:name (xs:string) - The identifier of the CryptoKitty matronId (xs:string) - The identifier of the CryptoKittys matron sireId (xs:string) - The identifier of the CryptoKittys sire genes (xs:int) - The CryptoKittys DNA In addition, each event has a set of standard attributes: concept:name (xs:string) - The class of the event time:timestamp (xs:date) - The timestamp of the block that included the event lifecycle:transition (xs:string) - The lifecycle transition of each event, for all events set to Completed by default.

In the analysis, we used process discovery to contrast the DApps behavior in these two periods. We showed how the CryptoKitty developer initially generated a set of CryptoKitties that were later sold to DApp users who bred and traded CryptoKitties. In contrast to these two logs, the event log provided on this page contains data about all CryptoKitty events that occurred in between blocks 4605167 (the creation block) and 12243999 (the block at which data extraction finished).

The hunters can hunt chicken or attack other hunters and this way collect chicken which can be converted into Ether. A hunters abilities are determined by the consitution of the pets, items and depot that the hunter owns. To improve the hunters abilities, players can upgrade items, pets, and depot. Through such investments, players also earn shares which they can cash out or transfer to other players and accounts. 4.1 Data Overview Each trace in the ChickenHunt log captures the events that occur during the game of a ChickenHunt player, i.e., the actions that a ChickenHunt player takes or is part of when playing the game.
